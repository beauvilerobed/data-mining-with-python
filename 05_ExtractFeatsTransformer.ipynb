    "# Extracting Features with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we have used so far have been described in terms of features. In the previous notebooks, we used a transaction-centric dataset. However, ultimately this was just a different format for representing feature-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other types of datasets, including text, images, sounds, movies, or even real objects. Most data mining algorithms, however, rely on having numerical or categorical features. This means we need a way to represent these types before we input them into the data mining algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts:\n",
    "- Extracting features from datasets\n",
    "- Creating new features\n",
    "- Selecting good features\n",
    "- Creating your own transformer for custom datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting features is one of the most critical tasks in data mining, and **it generally affects your end result more than the choice of data mining algorithm**. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules for choosing features that will result in high performance data mining. In many ways, this is where the science of data mining becomes more of an art. Creating good features relies on intuition, domain expertise, data mining experience, trial and error, and sometimes a little luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing reality in models\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all datasets are presented in terms of features. Sometimes, a dataset consists of nothing more than all of the books that have been written by a given author. Sometimes, it is the film of each of the movies released in 1979. At other times, it is a library collection of interesting historical artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these datasets, we may want to perform a data mining task. For the books, we may want to know the different categories that the author writes. In the films, we may wish to see how women are portrayed. In the historical artifacts, we may wantto know whether they are from one country or another. It isn't possible to just pass these raw datasets into a decision tree and see what the result is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data mining algorithm to assist us here, we need to represent these as features. Features are a way to create a model and the model provides an *approximation* of reality in a way that data mining algorithms can understand. Therefore, **a model is just a simplified version of some aspect of the real world**. As an example, the game of chess is a simplified model for historical warfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting features has another advantage: they reduce the complexity of the real world into a more manageable model. Imagine how much information it would take to properly, accurately, and fully describe a real-world object to someone that has no background knowledge of the item. You would need to describe the size, weight,\n",
    "texture, composition, age, flaws, purpose, origin, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of real objects is too much for current algorithms, so we use these simpler models instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a downside as this simplification reduces the detail, or may remove good indicators of the things we wish to perform data mining on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought should always be given to how to represent reality in the form of a model. Rather than just using what has been used in the past, you need to consider the goal of the data mining exercise. What are you trying to achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Not all features need to be numeric or categorical. Algorithms have been developed that work directly on text, graphs, and other data structures. Unfortunately, those algorithms are outside the scope of\n",
    "this notebook. In this book, we mainly use numeric or categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adult dataset is a great example of taking a complex reality and attempting to model it using features. In this dataset, the aim is to estimate if someone earns more than $50,000 per year.

    "\n",
    "While there are millions of ways to create features, there are some common patterns that are employed across different disciplines. However, choosing appropriate features is tricky and it is worth considering how a feature might correlate to the end result. As the adage says, don't judge a book by its cover—it is probably not worth considering the size of a book if you are interested in the message contained within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used features focus on the physical properties of the real world objects being studied, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spatial properties such as the length, width, and height of an object\n",
    "- Weight and/or density of the object\n",
    "- Age of an object or its components\n",
    "- The type of the object\n",
    "- The quality of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features might rely on the usage or history of the object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The producer, publisher, or creator of the object\n",
    "- The year of manufacturing\n",
    "- The use of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features describe a dataset in terms of its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequency of a given subcomponent, such as a word in a book\n",
    "- Number of subcomponents and/or the number of different subcomponents\n",
    "- Average size of the subcomponents, such as the average sentence length\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal features allow us to perform ranking, sorting, and grouping of similar values. Features can be numerical or categorical. Numerical features are often described as being **ordinal**. For example, three people, Alice, Bob and Charlie, may have heights of 1.5 m, 1.6 m and 1.7 m. We would say that Alice and Bob are more similar in height than are Alice and Charlie."

We can call any person who is taller than 1.7 m tall, and any person shorter than 1.7 m short. This gives us a categorical feature (although still an ordinal one). We do lose some data here. For instance, two people, one 1.69 m tall and one 1.71 m, will be in two different categories and considered drastically different from each other. In contrast, a person 1.2 m tall will be considered \"of roughly the same height\" as the person 1.69 m tall!

    "## Creating good features\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling, and the loss of information that the simplification causes, are the reasons why we do not have data mining methods that can just be applied to any dataset. A good data mining practitioner will have, or obtain, domain knowledge in the area they are applying data mining to. They will look at the problem, the available data, and come up with a model that represents what they are trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a height feature may describe one component of a person, but may not describe their academic performance well. If we were attempting to predict a person's grade, we may not bother measuring each person's height.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where data mining becomes more art than science. Extracting good features is difficult and is the topic of significant and ongoing research. Choosing better classification algorithms can improve the performance of a data mining application, but choosing better features is often a better option. In all data mining applications, you should first outline what you are looking for before you start designing the methodology that will find it. This will dictate the types of features you are aiming for, the types of algorithms that you can use, and the expectations on the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature selection\n",
    "We will often have a large number of features to choose from, but we wish to select\n",
    "only a small subset. There are many possible reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reducing complexity**: Many data mining algorithms need more time and resources with increase in the number of features. Reducing the number of features is a great way to make an algorithm run faster or with fewer resources.\n",
    "- **Reducing noise**: Adding extra features doesn't always lead to better performance. Extra features may confuse the algorithm, finding correlations and patterns that don’t have meaning (this is common in smaller datasets). Choosing only the appropriate features is a good way to reduce the chance of random correlations that have no real meaning.\n",
    "- **Creating readable models**: While many data mining algorithms will happily compute an answer for models with thousands of features, the results may be difficult to interpret for a human. In these cases, it may be worth using fewer features and creating a model that a human can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classification algorithms can handle data with issues such as these. Getting the data right and getting the features to effectively describe the dataset you are modeling can still assist algorithms. There are some basic tests we can perform, such as ensuring that the features are at least different. If a feature's values are all same, it can't give us extra information to perform our data mining.\n",
    "\n",

Therefore, finding just the first few features is often enough to\n",

It takes data of a specific format as input and returns data of another format (either the same as the input or different) as output.\n",

Any value higher than the mean (of the training data) will be given the value 1 and any value lower or equal to the mean will be given the value 0.\n",
