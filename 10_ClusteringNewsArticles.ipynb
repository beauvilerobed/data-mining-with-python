    "# Clustering News Articles\n",

    "Previously, we performed data mining knowing what we were looking for. Our use of target classes allowed us to learn how our variables model those targets during the training phase. This type of learning, where we have targets to train against, is called **supervised learning**. Here, we consider what we do without those targets. This is **unsupervised learning** and is much more of an exploratory task. Rather than wanting to classify with our model, the goal in unsupervised learning is more about exploring the data to find insights.\n",

    "## Grouping news articles\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to discover trends in news articles by clustering, or grouping, them together. To do that, we will use the k-means algorithm, a classic machine-learning algorithm originally developed in 1957.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique and we use clustering algorithms for exploring data. Our dataset contains approximately 360 stories, and it would be quite arduous to examine each of those stories individually. Even if we used summary statistics, that is still a lot of data. Using clustering allows us to group similar stories together, and we can explore the themes in each cluster independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use clustering techniques when we don't have a clear set of target classes for our data. In that sense, clustering algorithms have little direction in their learning. They learn according to some function, regardless of the underlying meaning of the data. For this reason, it is critical to choose good features. In supervised learning, if you choose poor features, the learning algorithm can choose to not use those features. For instance, support vector machines will give little weight to features that aren't useful in classification. However, with clustering, all features are used in the final result—even if those features don't provide us with the answer we were looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing cluster analysis on real-world data, it is always a good idea to have a sense of what sorts of features will work for your scenario. We will use the bag-of-words model. We are looking for topic-based groups, so we will use topic-based features to model the documents. We know those features work because of the work others have done in supervised versions of our problem. In contrast, if we were to perform an authorship-based clustering, we would use features such as those found in 9, Authorship Attribution experiment."

    "## The k-means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means clustering algorithm finds **centroids** that best represent the data using an iterative process. The algorithm starts with a predefined set of centroids, which are normally data points taken from the training data. The $k$ in k-means is the number of centroids to look for and how many clusters the algorithm will find. For instance, setting k to 3 will find three clusters in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two phases to the k-means: assignment and updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we set a label to every sample in the dataset linking it to the nearest centroid. \n",
    "    - For each sample nearest to centroid 1, we assign the label 1. \n",
    "    - For each sample nearest to centroid 2, we assign a label 2 and so on for each of the k centroids. \n",
    "    - We say that each data point with the label 1 is in cluster 1 (at this time only, as assignments can change as the algorithm runs).\n",
    "- In the updating step, we take each of the clusters and compute the centroid, which is the mean of all of the samples in that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then iterates between the assignment step and the updating step; each time the updating step occurs, each of the centroids moves a small amount. This causes the assignments to change slightly, causing the centroids to move a small amount in\n",
    "the next iteration. This repeats until some stopping criterion is reached. It is common to stop after a certain number of iterations, or when the total movement of the centroids is very low. The algorithm can also complete in some scenarios, which means that the\n",

    "Overall, the value of the inertia should decrease with reducing improvement as the number of clusters improves, which we can broadly see from these results. The increase between values of 6 to 7 is due only to the randomness in selecting the centroids, which directly affect how good the final results are. Despite this, there is a general trend (in these results; your results may vary) that about 6 clusters is the last time a major improvement in the inertia occurred. \n",

    "After this point, only slight improvements are made to the inertia, although it is hard to be specific about vague criteria such as this. Looking for this type of pattern is called the elbow rule, in that we are looking for an elbow-esque bend in the graph. Some datasets have more pronounced elbows, but this feature isn't guaranteed to even appear (some graphs may be smooth!). Based on this analysis, we set n_clusters to be 6 and then rerun the algorithm:"

    "only a few samples. Neural networks are a standard example of an algorithm that\n",
    "works in an online fashion. As a new sample is given to the neural network, the\n",
    "weights in the network are updated according to a learning rate, which is often a\n",
    "very small value such as 0.01. This means that any single instance only makes a small\n",
    "(but hopefully improving) change to the model. \n",
    "\n",

    "given at once and the training is done in one step. Algorithms are faster in batch\n",
    "mode, but use more memory.\n",

    "In this same vein, we can slightly update the k-means centroids after a single or small\n",
