    "# Predicting Sports Winners with Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will look at predicting the winner of sports matches using a different type of classification algorithm: decision trees. These algorithms have a number of advantages over other algorithms. One of the main advantages is that they are readable by humans. In this way, decision trees can be used to learn a procedure,\n",
    "which could then be given to a human to perform if needed. Another advantage is that they work with a variety of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be looking at predicting the winner of games of the **National Basketball Association (NBA)**. Matches in the NBA are often close and can be decided in the last minute, making predicting the winner quite difficult. Many sports share this characteristic, whereby the expected winner could be beaten by another team on the right day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various research into predicting the winner suggests that there may be an upper limit to sports outcome prediction accuracy which, depending on the sport, is between 70 percent and 80 percent accuracy. There is a significant amount of research being performed into sports prediction, often through data mining or statistics-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using is the match history data for the NBA for the 2013-2014 season. The website http://Basketball-Reference.com contains a significant number of resources and statistics collected from the NBA and other leagues. To download the dataset, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2014_games.html in your web browser.\n",
    "2. Choose to get table as csv file for each month\n",
    "3. copy and paste the csv to your data folder and make a note of the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download a **CSV** (short for **Comma Separated Values**) file containing the\n",
    "results of the 1,230 games in the regular season for the NBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files are simply text files where each line contains a new row and each value is separated by a comma (hence the name). CSV files can be created manually by simply typing into a text editor and saving with a *.csv* extension. They can also be opened in any program that can read text files, but can also be opened in Excel as a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will load the file with the **pandas** (short for **Python Data Analysis**) library, which is an incredibly useful library for manipulating data. Python also contains a,built-in library called *csv* that supports reading and writing CSV files. However, we will use pandas, which provides more powerful functions that we will use later in the chapter for creating new features."

    "## Decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a class of supervised learning algorithm like a flow chart that consists of a sequence of nodes, where the values for a sample are used to make a decision on the next node to go to.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most classification algorithms, there are two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first is the training stage, where a tree is built using training data. While the nearest neighbor algorithm from the previous chapter did not have a training phase, it is needed for decision trees. In this way, the nearest neighbor algorithm is a *lazy learner*, only doing any work when it needs to make a prediction. In contrast, decision trees, like most classification methods, are *eager learners*, undertaking work at the training stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The second is the predicting stage, where the trained tree is used to predict the classification of new samples. Using the previous example tree, a data point of [\"is raining\", \"very windy\"] would be classed\n",
    "as \"bad weather\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scikit-learn` package implements the **CART** (**Classification and Regression Trees**) algorithm as its default decision tree class, which can use both categorical and continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters in decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important features for a decision tree is the stopping criterion. Using such specific nodes\n",
    "can results in trees that significantly overfit the training data. Instead, a stopping criterion can be used to ensure that the decision tree does not reach this exactness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a stopping criterion, the tree could be created in full and then trimmed. This trimming process removes nodes that do not provide much information to the overall process. This is known as pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree implementation in scikit-learn provides a method to stop the\n",
    "building of a tree using the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `min_samples_split`: This specifies how many samples are needed in order to create a new node in the decision tree\n",
    "- `min_samples_leaf`: This specifies how many samples must be resulting from a node for it to stay\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter for decision tress is the criterion for creating a decision. Gini impurity and Information gain are two popular ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gini impurity**: This is a measure of how often a decision node would incorrectly predict a sample's class\n",
    "- **Information gain**: This uses information-theory-based entropy to indicate how much extra information is gained by the decision node\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import the DecisionTreeClassifier class and create a decision tree using scikit-learn:"
